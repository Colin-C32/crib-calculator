This mobile app is a cribbage calculator designed to help players make optimal discard choices. It combines precalculated averages with a brute-force algorithm to determine the average, minimum, and maximum possible scores, offering insight into the best cards to throw. The calculator focuses on hand and potential crib scores and does not factor in pegging considerations.
